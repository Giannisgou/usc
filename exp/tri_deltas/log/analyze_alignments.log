The optional-silence phone sil occupies 16.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 62.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 14.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.7 hours of data, or 1.4 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,23.2,73)
