The optional-silence phone sil occupies 54.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 51.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 11.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 2.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (28,42.2,128)
